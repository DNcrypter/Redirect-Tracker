Designed to identify ðŸ”Ž open redirect vulnerabilitiesðŸª² which can be chained ðŸ”—âš“ with other vulnerabilities. this tool leverages asynchronous operations that reduce scan time by **80%**, significantly enhancing its eficiency.âš“âš“

## Install
 ### clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DNcrypter/Redirect-Tracker.git
```
 ### move to directory
```sh 
cd Redirect-Tracker
```
### Run setup.sh
```sh
sudo chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

```

## Usage

You can run the script from the command line with these options:

```sh
Redirect-Tracker [-p payloads] [-k keyword] [-c concurrency] -v [verbose]
```

- `-p`, `--payloads`: File containing a list of payloads. If not specified, a hardcoded list is used.
- `-k`, `--keyword`: Keyword in URLs to replace with payload. Default is "FUZZ".
- `-c`, `--concurrency`: Number of concurrent tasks. Default is 50.

**Note**:- The script takes a list of URLs as input. Each URL must include the keyword defined by the -k option. The script substitutes the keyword with each payload and tries to fetch the modified URL.

**Example usage:**

```sh
cat list_of_urls.txt |  Redirect-Tracker -p payloads.txt -k "FUZZ" -c 100
```


 **List of URLs should look like below:**


```
$>> cat list_of_urls.txt

https://admin.xyz.com/logout?redirect=FUZZ
https://auth.xyz.com/auth/realms/sonatype/protocol/openid-connect/logout?redirect_uri=test
https://xyz.com/php?test=baz&foo=bar
```

This example reads URLs from the file `list_of_urls.txt`, replaces all the values of the parameters to `FUZZ` (if `--keyword` is not supplied), then again replaces the keyword `FUZZ` or the supplied keyword with each payload from `payloads.txt`, and fetches each URL concurrently, with a maximum of 50 concurrent tasks.



## DependenciesðŸ”—

The script uses the following libraries:

- `argparse` for handling command-line arguments.
- `aiohttp` for making HTTP requests.
- `tqdm` for displaying progress.
- `concurrent.futures` for handling concurrent tasks.
- `asyncio` for managing asynchronous tasks.

All dependencies are already installed using setup.sh. If any error occurs use below cmd:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
### Disclaimer:ðŸ”ŽðŸ”Ž
You can use this script to check for open redirects in web applications. However, you should only use it on systems that you have been given explicit permission to test.
